## Overview

I wanted to create a github version of [this](https://codesandbox.io/embed/2v716k56pr) demo code sandbox as well as provide some documentation for how it works. [Here](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/use-chain) is the page of the official React-Spring docs where this demo is shown.

The demo is a good UX component to know how to use. It provides white space emphasizing a title or call to action and smoothly transitions the user to some content related to that.

I wanted to imagine what I could do with this component in the context of a blog. 

If you want to avoid clutter on your page but also want to include a grid of content like blog posts you can use this component to accomplish that.
