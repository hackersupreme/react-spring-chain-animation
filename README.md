## Overview

I wanted to create a github version of [this](https://codesandbox.io/embed/2v716k56pr) demo code sandbox as well as provide some documentation for how it works. [Here](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/use-chain) is the page of the official React-Spring docs where this demo is shown.

The demo is a good UI component to know how to use. It provides white space emphasizing a title or call to action and smoothly transitions the user to some content related to that.

I wanted to imagine what I could do with this component in the context of a blog. 

If you want to avoid clutter on your page but also want to include a grid of content like blog posts you can use this component to accomplish that.

## Installation

These steps assume you have [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.

1. Create local directory for the project to live in
2. Download the files into that directory
3. Use a [cli](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp) and navigate into that directory
4. Use `npm install` to download the necessary node modules
5. Use `gatsby develop` to launch the server
